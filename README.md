# Kano World SDK source code archive

Saved using the Chrome extension [Save All Resources](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-all-resources/abpdnfjocnmdomablahdcfnoggeeiedb).

### How is this possible?

Because Kano Computing forgot to disable sourcemaps in production on the iHeart Site 🙃

I've archived them here on GitHub for educational purposes.
